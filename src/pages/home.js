                        Hello my name is Sergio Bracamontes, I am 32 and originally from Parkersburg,
                        WV but currently reside in Austin, TX.</p>

                    <p className="card-text"> I graduated from Parkersburg High School in 2006. Continuing my pursuit of knowledge I enrolled
                        at Wheeling Jesuit University and finished with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Communications in 2010.
                        After college, I then went on to pursue a career in teaching and in coaching. I was hired on by
                        the Linsly School in Wheeling, WV, as an intern that let me pursue that career for a year. I
                        went on to further my coaching career and reenrolled into Wheeling Jesuit University as a
                        graduate assistant for the swim team, while pursuing my Masters in Business.</p>

                    <p className="card-text">After coaching I went back to school at West Virginia University, where I acquired a certificate
                        in Chemical Operations and was able to intern for DuPont. I was immediately hired after
                        completing my program by DuPont as a process operator. Advancing myself to a shift supervisor, I
                        felt that it was time to advance myself further and proceed to enroll into the University of
                        Texas Coding Bootcamp. I hope to further my career in computer programming and am looking
                        forward to the challenge.</p>
